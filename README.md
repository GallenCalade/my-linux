# My Personalized Linux Auto Configuration

This repository is my personal customized Linux configuration, including beautifying Linux and useful apps installations with configurations which can be installed automatically.

# Notes

If you have any interesting and useful softwares, please let me know, and I will place it in apps.

Configurations and installations is personalized by me, some options might be wrong and not are suitable for you. Please DO NOT contribute any PR to me, while you may fork this repository and customize your self themes, path, configures and other options in case of breaking your system environment. Reading all the blow is first step to defend and customize your own Linux.

# Start to Install

You can just start with:

```bash
$ ./auto-install.sh
```

All is going automatically.

dependency of configurations.
